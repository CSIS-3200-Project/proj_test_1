# proj_test_1

## Purpose

Sample Flutter app for Juan to test his encryption methods on.
Right now, it only takes an input in the "Input Field" and outputs it into the "Output Field". The rest of the functionality will be up to Juan.

Changes should only be made within the `flutter_test_1/lib/changes_here/` folder. None of the other folders or files should be touched, unless you know what you're doing.

If you have any questions, please ask Helmi.
